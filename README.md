#Caesar Cipher and Fair Play Cipher
This repository contains two classic encryption techniques - Caesar Cipher and Fair Play Cipher.

#Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. In this implementation, the user can select the number of positions to shift the letters. The program can be run from the command line and can handle uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters.

#Fair Play Cipher
Fair Play Cipher is a more complex encryption technique that was used during World War II by the German military. It involves a polyalphabetic substitution system that uses a set of keys to encrypt the plaintext. This implementation of Fair Play Cipher uses a randomly generated set of keys for encryption and decryption. The program can also be run from the command line and can handle uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters.

#Installation
To run the programs, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To use the programs, simply download the repository and run the scripts in a Python environment or from the command line.

#Usage
Caesar Cipher
To use Caesar Cipher, navigate to the caesar_cipher folder and run the script from the command line using the following command:

Copy code
python caesar_cipher.py
You will be prompted to enter the plaintext and the number of positions to shift the letters. The encrypted text will be printed to the console.

Fair Play Cipher
To use Fair Play Cipher, navigate to the fair_play_cipher folder and run the script from the command line using the following command:

Copy code
python fair_play_cipher.py
You will be prompted to enter the plaintext. The encrypted text will be printed to the console, along with the randomly generated keys used for encryption and decryption.
